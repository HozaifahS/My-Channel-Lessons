######## Example 1 - basic input variable defined:  ########

# SIDE NOTE : Always remember, whenever you define an input variable, it's automatically going to print so place it in the correct place !!

ques = input("How are you feeling today?")

# No need for ; print(ques) ;  :)

######## Example 2 - Actually using the input variable: ########

ques1 = input("What is your username: ")

print("OK, " + ques2)

######## Example 3 - Wrapping it sll up and creating a little code: ########

ques1 = input("What is your username: ")
ques2 = input("WHat weapon does " + que1 + " hold?")
summary = ("Just to confirm, your username is " + que1 + " and they have a " + ques2 + ". Right? y/n)")

print("OK : " + str(summary))
